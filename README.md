# PWC_POWER-BI-INTERNSHIP

During this program, I performed various tasks that helped me learn essential skills required for data analysis and data visualization using Power BI in a meaningful manner.
 
**TASK 1 : Call Centre Analysis**
► As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created a "Call Center Analysis" Dashboard, using Power BI. This dataset containing call records from a customer service center. Each row represents a call with various attributes such as Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, whether it was Answered (Yes/No), Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration.

➡️ Objective:
» The objective of the dashboard is to deliver meaningful insights and actionable information to empower the Call Centre.

➡️ 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 :-
1] 𝐓𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐜 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

» Payment-related issues seem to be the most common topic, followed by Technical Support and Contract-related queries.

» Admin Support and Streaming-related issues appear to have lower call volumes compared to other topics.

2] 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞 :

» Contract-related queries, Technical Support and Payment-related calls shows a high resolution rate.

3] 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫

» The average speed of answer varies across different topics, with some topics having quicker response times than others.

» Admin Support and Contract-related calls tend to have faster response times compared to Technical Support and Payment-related calls.

4] 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞

» To analyze the performance of individual agents based on metrics like average talk duration, resolution rate, and speed of answer.

» Top-performing agents like Martha, Diane could be identified for recognition or additional training, while areas for improvement could be highlighted for others.

5] 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:

» There may be certain peak hours or periods of the day when call volumes are higher, which could help in optimizing agent scheduling.

» 11, 13,17 peak hours of the day, when call volumes are higher.

6] 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :

» Understanding the relationship between call resolution and customer satisfaction could provide valuable insights into service quality.

» Monitoring unresolved calls and their impact on customer satisfaction could be crucial for improving overall customer experience.

7] 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :

» Identifying topics with higher call volumes or longer average talk durations could indicate areas where additional training or resources may be needed.

» Optimizing agent allocation based on call volumes and topics could help in improving efficiency and customer service quality.

✅ These insights can serve as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making aimed at improving customer service operations and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

**✨ TASK 2 : Customer Churn Analysis**
» As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created a "𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬" Dashboard, using Power BI.

➡️ Objective :
The Telecommunications Retention Manager is actively seeking a comprehensive solution to elevate customer retention efforts and mitigate customer churn.

➼ Churn Rate :
The churn rate, which indicates the percentage of customers who stopped using the service during a certain time period, seems to be a significant factor. It would be helpful to analyze the churn rate to understand why customers are leaving and take appropriate actions to reduce it.

➼ Demographic Analysis :
• 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :

This section displays the count of customers based on their gender, categorized as male and female.

• 𝐓𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐫𝐞 :

The tenure of customers varies widely, ranging from 1 to 72 months. This suggests that the service has both new and long-standing customers.

• 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 :

Fiber optic appears to be the most popular internet service among customers, followed by DSL.

• 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 :

Customers who have subscribed to online security and tech support services have a lower churn rate as they value security and assistance.

•𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 :

Customers with longer contract durations (e.g., one year or two years) is less likely to churn compared to those on a month-to-month contract.

➼ Billing & Payment :
• 𝐏𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 :

Customers who opt for paperless billing may have different behavior compared to those who receive paper bills.

• 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝 :

The choice of payment method (e.g., electronic check, credit card, bank transfer) might influence customer loyalty and churn rate.

• 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐬 :

Monthly charges vary across customers, with some paying as low as $20 and others paying over $100. Understanding the reasons behind these differences can help in pricing strategies and customer retention efforts.

➡️ Insights of the Projects :-
Overview:
Total customers are 7043 with number of retained customers is 5174 & customers churned are 1869.

The rate of retained customers is 73.46% & the rate of churned customers is 26.54%, amounting to $16.06M yearly charges and $456.12K monthly charges.

2955 tech tickets and 3632 admin tickets opened.

There are about 16.21% customers who are senior citizens & percentage of senior citizens in churned customers is 25.46%.

Demographics:
Churn rate is higher for customers who have opted for Internet Services. Customers with Fiber Optic services have higher churn rate that is 69.39%.

Average Tenure of customers is 32.37% & Average Tenure of churned customers is 17.89.

It is observed that, customers with low tenure are churned more.

Subscription:
• Tech support should be improved more.

• Company should focus on customers with shorter customers ass they are more likely to be churned.

• As the churn rate is higher for internet services in fiber optic, telecom company should focus more on retaining those customers and improve in that area.

• Customers should be subscribed to more services & plans with longer tenures which are offered by the company's

✨ 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝟑 : Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard
► As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have developed a "𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧" Dashboard using Power BI.

► Telecom client partners with PwC Switzerland to boost executive gender balance through diversity and inclusion.

► The task involves developing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, along with creating a visualization to track and communicate progress.

► Goal: A valued and inclusive environment for all teams.

✤ During the project below is the points cover in dashboard :-

1] No. of Employee

2] No. of Men Employee

3] No. of Female Employee

4] Hired Employees Men vs Female.

5] Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)

6] Male Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)

7] Female Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)

8] Turnover

9] Average Performance Rating Men

10] Average Performance Rating Women

➡️ Key Performance Indicators ( KPI'S) :
➤ 𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠:

By tracking % of hires Men vs. Women, we gain visibility into recruitment practices, ensuring a balanced workforce from the outset.

➤ 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :

Measuring % of promotions- Men vs. Women, identifying and celebrating talent, ensuring opportunities are equitable and merit-based.

➤ 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 :

Assessing average performance ratings - Men vs. Women, pinpoint potential biases and create a fair evaluation system.

➤ 𝐓𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 :

Monitoring % turnover - Men vs. Women, identify areas of concern, ensuring our workplace retains diverse talent.

» The final goal is the practical approach to address gender balance challenges in the workplace. The goal is not only to set strategic objectives but also to measure, analyze, and continuously improve diversity and inclusion initiatives.
